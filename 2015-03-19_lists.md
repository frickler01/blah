# Lists in C and other horrors

## Finding the right data type library

I was actually trying to be lazy (or smart-ish) and not [re-invent the wheel for the godzillionth time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) by choosing some sensible pre-made library for *reaaaally* basic stuff one would assume to use on a regular basis - like lists.  
Fortunately, I was

[the](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1819416/standard-data-structure-library-in-c?rq=1)

have this problem. Thank you, Internet.

Okay, there is no Standard Implementationâ„¢ for lists in C, which is strange enough after more than 40 years of its existence. But lots of people spent lots of time on providing lots of code. Here is what I found:

* [sys/queue.h](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/queue.3.html)
* [linux/list.h](http://ccodearchive.net/info/list.html)
* [Glib](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.42/)
* [gnulib](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/)
* [Simple Generic Library](http://sglib.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html)
* [Generic Data Structures Library](http://home.gna.org/gdsl/)
* [C Container Library](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/ccl/ccl.html)
* [C Generic Library](http://code.google.com/p/c-generic-library/)
* [Small Container Library](https://github.com/djerome/libscl)
* [qLibc](https://github.com/wolkykim/qlibc)

There is a bunch of different approaches and each of them seems to have a fair amount of reason behind it. I haven't looked into all of them very closely, let alone run or tested anything. However I'd also like to give my [$.002](http://stackoverflow.com/a/736333) on some aspects.

## They all have their benefits

`sys/queue.h` and `SGLIB` seem to be the only approaches using macros and the `SGLIB` author argues it is faster than calling functions. I'd like to see some numbers on that. I think the design is very clear and, at least to me, very readable, in spite of all the underscores. At least it is made clear in the doc why they're needed. A great thing about `SGLIB` is that it's contained in a single 2k-lines header file that doesn't make the impression it will make your humble 1k-line program burst of bloat. Maybe it would be better (read: more tidy) if `level 1` functions resided in a different file, but this would be a minor change as far as I can see.

`Glib`, as the author of `libscl` puts it, *redefines the whole world* and for some reason even has its on `gint` type which is just an alias to `int`. This sounds plausible only in those cases where you want to ensure portability, like for the other numerical types and their sizes/ranges. Other than that it offers a metric shitload of functionality I hardly imagine to ever understand even superficially. While I very much like the documentation that makes usage very easy - this is the only library I tested to link against - you have to make sure your user has the whole library available, even if you don't need 99,9% of it. On the other hand - do we have to care? Its 2015, geesh.

Similarly `gnulib` wants to encompass everything imaginable or as they put it `to provide all the common infrastructure needed by GNU packages`. Which doesn't matter, since the nice thing about `gnulib` is that the whole idea is to cherry-pick source files as needed. But personally I find the code harder to read and thus harder to understand the interface I actually want to use. Probably it's just the form of the documentation that is only available inside the code and not in finely designed web formats. I didn't try yet, but putting together the correct header files sounds tedious. A brilliant aspect of the documentation with regard to content is that each function for each variant of the generic list implementation is provided with its complexity. A lot of people do it, but why doesn't everybody do it?! Oh right, the cost.

The decision for one over the other seems to boil down to a matter of taste. Or maybe ability to follow the authors' design decisions. Or being able to read that specific code and naming style fluently. My impression is that the a good documentation of technical detail is necessary, but not enough to build enough trust to spend time learning the inner workings. Arguing about intent and the decisions made is just as important.

## We could do better

But I'm still disappointed. Seriously, why the hell couldn't we settle on some basic core functionality and an open source reference implementation? There is *so much* standardization already present in the C world, and adding to that all kinds of useful conventions. The folks of IBM managed to supply the world with `an ultimate` implementation of sin and cos routines. (Interestingly, it's not *the* ultimate...) Why can't we do such thing with simple data containers? Even if there is no perfect allround solution, the field seems properly explored to compile the handful of context-specific *best available* solutions in a scientific manner, decide on a proper interface design, implement it and then go do something more fun for the rest of the Unix epoch. What I mean with scientific is something like [this guy](http://stackoverflow.com/a/10997428) has done to present the most efficient and concise way to compare integers in pure C.

Also, I don't get why there is [only one post](http://jeapostrophe.github.io/2012-03-31-siq-reve-post.html) in two pages of Google on reversing doubly linked lists in O(1) time by just setting a reverse flag and let the handling functions deal with it appropriately. Why haven't people done this like 40 years ago and teach it to every CS student out there?

## Maybe the problem is something else

On a different but related toppic, there was a [comment](http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/a/8984) which suggested that the existing codebase relied on older foundations which to rebuild would not bring any benefit, only pain. I perfectly agree. Though for any new project or any beginner like me it would be very nice to use something pre-made, battle-hardened and just go on coding new, interesting stuff instead of wasting time thinking about the best *implementation* to use - of things other languages provide built-in, no questions asked. And with 'best' I mean best in usability, durability, features and performance.

But then again, even those large open source libraries are big piles of legacy code no one ever would dare to merge in any way. The only thing left is to create [yet another library](http://xkcd.com/927/) (maybe with help of some automation since so much already exists). And while Randall's joke has some truth to it if your thinking is limited to looking at Wikipedia [lists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lists_of_lists), there is a lot more truth to the honest approach to actually build a *better* standard. Or did you ever complain about how inconsistent and incomprehensible the metric system is? Also, see UTF, DIN paper formats and basically any other sane standardization effort.

## What to do?

Writing a rant may not really help a lot for that matter. What should be done is more thorough research on available solutions as well as their benefits and drawbacks. Maybe there already *is* a holy grail of C list implementations out there and most people just don't know. Or it's just not on first page of Google search and therefore doesn't exist. Anyway, Doing It Right sounds awfully frightening and like much work that won't be honored. [Programming sucks](http://stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks).
