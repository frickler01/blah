# Digital text formatting

I've recently read an entertaining [flame war](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17) conducted by Linus Torvalds on the topic of git commit text formatting.

Torvalds [alleges](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17#issuecomment-5661185) an amazing thing:
> Word-wrapping is a property of the *text*.

A semantic property, to make this out-of-context quote clear, arguing that a software (in this case git console) is not able to discern which parts of a text to auto-wrap on presentation and which to leave intact. And thus he hard-wraps all of his writing to 72 characters, demanding it from anyone else - in this specific case, anyone who wants to contribute to the kernel.

Seems like it never appeared to him and some of his followers that separation of content and presentation might be a good idea. One person commented on this [very clearly](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17#issuecomment-11738817). I simply don't understand the line of argument from the hard-wrappers here. There might have been a point in time where git didn't have the ability to pre-format text according to a given viewport. [This guy](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17#issuecomment-5681549) simply implemented one.

Linus might be referring to the Unix-principle, claiming each tool is supposed to do exactly one job very well, and wrapping lines or interpreting markup is none of `git`'s business. Agreed, but then text presentation is not to concern `git` at all. I may choose any tool to view a commit log. (As far as I know, `less` is used in this case, but how old is the principle behind `less` again and in what context was it conceived?)

Backwards compatibility might be an issue, or just trying not to re-invent the wheel all the time, and at points it is an important one. But it's very subtle as well. Trying to stay backwards compatible to terminals from the 80's is in general a good idea - just as trying to stay compatible to b/w television from the 30s up until recently was - but most (quasi-)standards emerged due to constraints, not because they were supposed to be the most comfortable thing to deal with for all eternity. It's just like in the arts: most of the time, styles were not developed to convey a specific way of thinking, but to deal with or circumvent technical or social limitations of a given era.

Since viewing devices have predominanlty become "progressive" instead of "interlaced" (and interlacing was exactly this kind of reaction to a bandwidth constraint), it doesn't make a lot of sense any more to continue working in interlaced mode until the end of days. So the industry just built backwards-wrappers for current devices/software and preserved the old data in it's original form. Why not do the exact same thing with everything? Concerning text, I think we are way past that line where we should start thinking outside the 80x25 terminal box. Even in the dark dungeons of programming.

The brilliant thing about the spirit of `markdown` is that with a simple, unintrusive markup encoding, we can stay backwards compatible to "dumb" text editors while simultaniously allowing to tweak text representation parameters independently of the content's semantics, if the tool in use supports it. Same goes for the thing that should have ended the tabs-spaces-debate once and for all: [elastic tabstops](http://nickgravgaard.com/elastic-tabstops/). We're not even talking about anything radically different or ambitious like the idea behind [Lamdu](http://peaker.github.io/lamdu/).

Separation of concerns is what got our Internet in all its glory into the 21st century in the first place. And it should be valued even more today. Avoiding unnecessary markup is good - and manual word-wrapping is absolutely unnecessary. Just as most of web page styling is. [This guy](http://camendesign.com/hello) gets it! And [this](http://toroid.org/ams/git-website-howto) is how a web page should more often look like. Ever heard of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)? Don't even get me started on Javascript.
