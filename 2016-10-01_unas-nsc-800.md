# 2016 NAS build

The goal of this exercise to buld a compact, quiet, low-power always-on NAS server with low to medium performance and 8 3.5" drives. It's supposed to mimic the Synology DS1813+ in all aspects except that it should provide flexibility in choosing operating systems.

# Hardware

## Case: [U-NAS NSC-800](http://www.u-nas.com/xcart/product.php?productid=17617)

The U-NAS NSC-800 is the most compact, richest-featured, no-bullshit case I could find. Just pop in a mini-ITX board and a 1U PSU. From the specs it's supposed to do the job well. Importing it to Europe made it cost abot 320 Euro including shipping and toll. First impressions.

### Pro

#### Mostly bolted

You can take off the top, back and front cover, disassemble the back part of the hard drive cage to reach the backplane. This is really good, since otherwise you could not work inside properly.

#### SATA backplane neatly pre-wired

The two molex power and two SAS breakout cables are tidily fixed up with cable straps and completely out of the way.

#### Utterly compact

This case is very compactly designed with its 25,5 x 31,5 x 19,0 cm. But there is still space for a full size PCIe card and two additional 2.5" drives.

#### Ingeniously simple and sturdy tray locking mechanism

This might be a detail, but concerning durability and repairability this is a big plus and deserves praise.

#### Sheet metal trays

Way more sturdy than plastic bays. The front side and levers are still plastic though, but that is okay.

### Con

#### Front plane plastic is rubber coated

This is a total killer. In about 5 years, the rubber will most probably start to peel off. Its also completely unnecessary.

#### No toolless trays

You have to screw the drives into the trays. That seems somewhat backward and is tedious. Ideally there wouldn't be any trays at all, but only hatches to cover the naked drives and push them out when opened. The latter would take more space and be more complicated to manufacture though.

#### Still lots of rivets left

You cannot disassemble the case completely to reuse or replace parts.

#### Not perfectly efficient use of space

You could still improve on the footprint with overall tighter tolerance (there is quite a bit of unnecessary air everywhere), by taking smaller mount plates and placing the 2.5" drives next to each other, replacing the 1U PSU with a Flex ATX one, chopping off some plastic on the drive trays' front, using a more sophisticated SATA backplane to get rid of excess cables and move the fans closer. A last resort would be potentially dropping the expansion card slot and move the mainboard to that spot to save another 4 cm of width.

#### SAS breakout cables

While this is a nice and tidy idea, there are currently almost no boards with SAS included, so you would need to waste the PCIe slot on that. This is of course somewhat biased towards low budget builds, where SAS and RAID cards are not really an option.

So beware that you will need up to 10 SATA cables if you want to fill all the storage options.

A more clever SATA cabling provision - like for example locating all connectors at one spot on the backplane or at least providing a means to stuff the excess cables somewhere - would be much more useful.

#### Topside mainboard mount weak

The mainboard is held in place by two long standoffs at the bottom and a thin metal bar at the top. If you accidentally apply some force, for example when trying to move the opened case, it bends very quickly and might break off. Its screwed to the frame, but one of the two screws is behind the plastic front panel. So I didn't bother to check how hard it would be to replace this part.

#### So-so fans

One of the fans is damaged and has an annoying sound. The other is pretty silent on low frequencies, but gets loud quickly when spun up. They're okay, but not top-notch. Probably better to replace by some known-good brand.

### Unknowns

#### LED brightness

The front panel LEDs are terribly bright, even at daylight, so I unplugged them. The HDD tray LEDs are somewhat bright as well, but it's okay. You can paint over the transparent plastic with a black marker (on the far side if you like it clean) if they annoy you, everything else would be too complicated.

![](/2016-10-01_unas-nsc-800/13.jpg)

#### Vibration

The rubber legs seem a bit firm and there is no damping on the trays except for the little hard plastic sheet that transmits the LED light to the front. There is also no space around the trays to put any felt between. The fans are labeled silent, but we will see how they perform.

## Mainboard: [ASRock C2550D4I](ttp://www.asrockrack.com/general/productdetail.asp?Model=C2550D4I)

This thing is a great server board! It runs an Atom C2000 and has six SATA-II and four SATA-III ports on three controllers, two GigaBit-Ethernet ports, a PCIe slot and a BNC-Port for remote controlling the power switch and temperature sensors over Ethernet. There is no sound and only a tiny on-board graphics chip with VGA port, which is fine for a server. Most importantly, it claims to run at only 19W at idle while offering reasonable performance reserves. Another great feature, that isn't even advertised, is that one of the SATA controllers allows staggered spinup to reduce peak load on the power supply. It does come with a price though - I got mine for 294 Euro.

## RAM: 4GB-Kit G.Skill ECO, DDR3L-1333, CL9-9-9-24

RAM draws quite a lot of power, since the capacitors storing information need to be recharged constantly. Thus it contributes noticably to the total footprint of the system. This model runs at 1.35V and is claimed to be especially efficient. While performance is not critical and one bar would be even cheaper on the electricity bill, dual channel use is a major improvement and therefore recommended. The memory came at about 33 Euro.

## Power supply: 1U or FlexATX between 150 and 300 W with at least 14A on 12V

There is no definite answer here, I think. What probably works well are these:

- Seasonic SS-300 M1U
- Seasonic SS-250 SU
- Seasonic SS-200 SU

In any case **you will need** a 24-pin ATX extension and either buy a premade adapter bracket or make one yourself. The distance from PSU to mainboard connector is about 45 cm, but the cables are usually only 30 cm long.

![](/2016-10-01_unas-nsc-800/17.jpg)

The U-NAS case has only two screw holes for "real" 1U PSUs, which are about 2cm wider.

![](/2016-10-01_unas-nsc-800/15.jpg)

I chose the Fortron FSP 150-50TNF 150W, because I thought "fully passive" is good and I don't need all that much power. Actually this is a bad decision for a couple of reasons.

- The Seasonic models all work in passive mode up to 50% load, but the fan could cool them down in an emergency.
- The Fortron outputs enough total power for the use case, but can only do 8A on 12V, which may become a problem with eight HDDs and a bunch of USB devices. You would rather want 14A to catch the peak current of 8x1.75A of the WD Reds. This is alleviated somewhat by the staggered spinup, but you never know. Your OS might wake all of them up at the same time after suspending.
- It is not a very good overall product. It's far from silent with its annoying coil whine (should be a bit less terrible inside the case) and the cabling is a nightmare. It was so mingled that I've redone it.

I will let it run and see how it performs.

All of them are in the range of 60-80 Euro, the smaller Seasonic ones are on the cheaper end.

## System disk: Samsung 850 Evo 250GB

Currently the lowest-power highest-performance SSD out there: 0.025 W idle and 1.72 W under load.[^1](http://www.anandtech.com/show/8747/samsung-ssd-850-evo-review/10)

## USB extension card: [StarTech PEXUSB3S4V](http://www.startech.com/Cards-Adapters/USB-3.0/Cards/4-Port-PCI-Express-PCIe-SuperSpeed-USB-3-Controller-Card~PEXUSB3S4V) (optional)

I use external USB 3.0 hard drives for cold backups, but the mainboard has only two USB 2.0 ports. There are also PEXUSB3S42V with two dedicated channels and PEXUSB3S7 with seven ports, but they cost a lot more and draw more power. This would only make sense if raw performance is important for some reason. The small variant should be around 40 Euro.

# Build

## PSU adapter

First of all I needed to adapt the PSU mount. This is basically two metal plates with holes that match the width. The ones I made only work for the Fortron style mount, the Seasonic ones would need an asymmetric layout.

## PSU cables

I clipped off the floppy and spare 4-pin connector. Who still needs floppy power anyway? Also the cables were tidied up a bit by changing where they are split up. This way you can move them around more flexibly. It shouldn't change electrical behavior, because the different colored wires run into the same spot on the PCB for each color anyway. Correct me if I'm wrong.

![](/2016-10-01_unas-nsc-800/18.jpg)

## SATA cables

It's a total mess, because the ports on the mainboard and on the backplane are all over the place. Most of the time you have spare cable length flying around. I somehow managed to accomodate it in the frame though, but that was no fun at all. SAS on-board would be nice, and/or the ports all next to each other.

![](/2016-10-01_unas-nsc-800/22.jpg)

The cable mess also impedes airflow a little bit, especially around the CPU heatsink, but it's not critical.

Other than that, it works and it's really compact.

# Running

The thing works as expected. CPU runs idle at about 50-60 °C on lowest fan speed - which isn't cool, but acceptable. Under load it never goes over 65 °C and the fans only occasionally spin up faster, but it's bearable. One day I might replace the louder stock fan.

I am quite surprised that vibration is no issue at all, since the Synology box really had problems with that. But that may have been because of the plastic parts in the drive trays.

Finally the PSU holds up fine with 6 HDDs running under load. You can still hear the whine through the case a little bit, but either I already got used to it or it's really not that noticable. Wakeup is also staggered, I guess the OS command is caught by the mainboard. So that worked out as well.
