# Workstation hardware

Can anybody tell me why there is no market for [HDD silencer boxes](http://www.quietpc.com/quiet-drive-2) any more?

SSDs are still way too expensive for use as mass storage that grows with your needs. Not everyone wants to outsource data storage to third parties. Racks full of cheap 3.5" drives are heavy, hot and loud. 2.5" drives are a good compromise. A single one may be barely audible on its own, but a bunch of them is already quite annoying. If you have a big old tower case anyway, you could just wrap the drives in cushioned enclosures for 3.5" slots and make them virtually silent, avoiding the hissing and clicking sounds.

This is exaclty what I did about five years ago and it was great. Now I'd like to update my box, but you simply can't buy the drive enclosures any more. Did people suddenly stop to use big-ass high performance computers at home?
