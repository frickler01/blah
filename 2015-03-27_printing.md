# I hate inkjet printers

Actually, they are a nice piece of hardware and some of them do a great job. Like my old friend the Canon iP4300, first bought in 2003. But the series has a chronic desease. Many devices just drop dead - at some point you simply can't turn them on any more. The internets are full of those stories.

This happend to me twice already. First I suspected a power supply failure. This wouldn't be so bad, because you can replace them without hassle. But then again it is possible to unplug the PSU's internal cable, plug the power in, then out again, reconnect the internal cable - and then it turns on. There are a lot of forums which deal with this thing. I read people saying everything is fine, but the mainboard doesn't completely fire up any more unless you perform said trick. But I only found that when my second second-hand piece tried to desert from duty like its predecessor, which I dumped on eBay for half of its original price. Who would buy dead printers for so much money?

A much more interesting thing is that, afterwards the dreaded 5-orange-blink error occured. This means that the print head is probably dead. You could replace it, but those things cost more than a new printer from the same market segment, no matter which model or age.

Rumor goes that even then you're screwed, because they say for some weird reason the mainboard dies as well (which would be cheap to buy though, but more work to replace).

My own story begins after I bought my third iP4300 for 10 EUR from some guy who said "it prints ugly" (shortly after understanding why people are inclined to spend 40+ EUR on 12+ year old printers - if you want this model, and you do because it served you well, they're just hard to find). After cleaning the head properly with glass cleaner and pumping two pages of each color through, it was good as new.

It must have been some kind of electrical failure that just happens after ~10 years of use. Or maybe it was the PSU's fault and doing "the trick" destroyed the board, which in turn destroyed the head. Who knows. Some on the nets say, the head wears off if you use the cheap ink (which I did from day one), short circuits eventually, takes the board with it, then the board refuses to boot until you do the PSU trick.

They say, curiosity killed the cat. My curiosity killed my third printer. I wanted to mythbust that mainboard thing I read and put the shiny working print head into the old box just to see what happens. Well, it did work. This confirmed that the old head was dead. But now it only printed every odd line of colors other than pigment black (the maintenance mode stuff worked fine except for the color parts). Myth confirmed: the board must be borked as well.

Put the head back in the good box, sell the old, don't risk the reverse experiment trying the dead head in the new box, I thought. You know, just in case the dying head really killed the board. EPIC FAIL. Even in the new printer, the new printhead I just tested, stopped printing the even color lines! I just wasted tons of dirt-cheap ink and a whole day.

Also, just two weeks before, my expensive I-still-have-a-year-of-warranty Brother DCP-J925DW stopped accepting magenta ink for no sane reason at all. Very probably the light sensor in the cardridge slot has a broken contact or has passed away altogether. Customer support refused to even look at it because I didn't have their Original Inkâ„¢ in the tubes. They wrote that they checked that somehow. WTF. My problem isn't even related to ink at all! It's crappy hardware.

I'd repair it myself, but it's quite hard to even get to that part (as opposed to completely dismantling the iP4300), and there are no spare parts available at all. Lately I saw that they discontinued the model a year ago and noone sells them used. No wonder - now there's even proof it's total shit.

Now I'm stuck here with three dead/useless printers.

While researching on the topic (Google: I hate inkjet printers) I could expand my horizon on the original-ink-rip-off scheme. Seemingly knowledgable people explained that while marketing tries to bullshit everyone by telling us these inks are rocket science, which justifies them being the most expensive liquid on earth, there is at least some grain of truth to it. Probably really cheap third party inks may destroy your print head eventually by corrosion and clogging the microscopic nozzles, which definitely should not happen with the original supplier's products. Also, manufacturers sell the actual printers way under value - despite the fact that heads/nozzles actually are rocket science and this may be why we don't see any chinese copycat inkjets - and calculate on the revenue generated by people who either don't know any better (like most) or don't want to take risks (like enterprises and really conservative people). This evil strategiy has historical reasons: When ink was cheap and printers were sold with margin, few bought them.

Now nearly everyone has a piece of this plague at home, throwing away 10 kg of plastic waste every two years, after the nozzles dry out or whatever. I'd be totally happy to go back to 90's conditions, pay 500 EUR for a decent device I keep until the rest of my days and which I can repair myself, but being able to spit out pages at <1ct without even thinking about it. Total lifetime cost (including psychologic) would still be less than right now.
